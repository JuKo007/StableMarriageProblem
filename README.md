# Stable Marriage Problem

This repository contains an R script to generate data for the stable marriage problem as an igraph network object, compute a solution to the graph and visualize the process and results. It's inspired by a numberphile video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qcv1IqHWAzg) and only a just for fun project.
